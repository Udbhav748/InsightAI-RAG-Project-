"""LLM router agent: classifies a query's intent and hands off to a
specialist agent or tool.

This is the planner half of the multi-agent design. ChatService's
deterministic keyword planner (rag_service._plan) can only recognize
small talk, "summarize <uuid>", or a generic document question — it has
no notion of "this needs multi-step web research." The router agent
upgrades exactly that: for anything the deterministic fast paths don't
lock down, it asks the LLM (in JSON mode) whether the query should go to
retrieval, summarization, or the Research agent.

Deliberate failure-safe design, mirroring the codebase's structured-output
philosophy (structured_output.py): a router parse failure, empty response,
or malformed action degrades to the keyword planner's decision — routing
is a quality improvement, never a new failure mode. Deterministic fast
paths (small talk, "summarize <uuid>") short-circuit before any LLM call.

RouterAgent is constructed with the keyword planner injected (a
callable taking query, history and returning something with `.action` and
`.document_id`), so this module never imports rag_service — no circular
dependency, and the fast-path/fallback behavior is unit-testable with a
stub planner.
