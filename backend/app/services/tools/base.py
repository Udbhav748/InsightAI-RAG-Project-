"""Core abstractions for the dynamic tool registry.

The registry (tools/registry.py) is the agent-facing way to invoke a tool
by name with validated arguments — the piece the Router/Planner/Executor
agents call instead of importing a service function directly. These are
the shared types everything in tools/ builds on:

- BaseTool:    the interface every tool implements (name, description,
               Pydantic args schema, declared output type, execute()).
- ToolContext: injected collaborators a tool needs at run time
               (vector_store, llm_client) plus auth/session context —
               the registry hands this in, tools never construct it.
- ToolResult:  the uniform envelope a tool returns; success/data/error so
               an agent can branch on outcome instead of catching.
- ToolSpec:    registry metadata (name, description, JSON schemas) used by
               prompt_builder-style model-facing tool lists and the eval
               harness.

Deliberately thin — no logic here, just contracts. Tools live in
tools/implementations.py, constructed in tools/factory.py.
