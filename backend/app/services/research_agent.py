"""The Research agent: a second, cooperating agent that owns the
weak/insufficient-retrieval path with a multi-step loop:
plan → search → read → synthesize.

Where the corrective RAG loop's web fallback is a single search_web() call
whose snippets are bolted onto the normal generation prompt, the Research
agent runs its own loop autonomously:

1. plan      — the LLM breaks the user's query into 1..N search queries.
2. search    — sub-queries run through the web-search tool in parallel
               (independent calls, no reason to pay their latency
               sequentially).
3. read      — the top pages are fetched in parallel and their text
               pulled into context (bounded: research_read_limit pages,
               research_page_max_chars chars each, per-page timeout).
4. synthesize— the agent builds its own grounded answer from what it
               collected and returns it to the orchestrator.

Steps 2 and 3 both share one wall-clock budget
(research_total_timeout_seconds): a step that's already out of budget
doesn't start, and an in-flight call that outlives it is abandoned
rather than awaited — the agent synthesizes from whatever finished in
time instead of blocking on the slowest search/fetch.

This is the multi-agent design the checklist asks for: the router agent
hands off to a specialist that does real work and reports back, rather
than the orchestrator calling a tool inline. Handoffs and agent lifecycle
are logged via agent_events.py so Handoff Accuracy / Agent Idle Time are
measurable.

Failure-safe by construction, like every enhancement in this codebase:
- No web search enabled? Returns empty findings; the orchestrator falls
  through to the normal retrieve path.
- Human-approval gate (web_search_requires_approval) applies: skipped
  unless confirm_web_search is true, exactly like the tool-level gate.
- A search that errors, a page that fails to fetch, or a synthesis that
  comes back empty all degrade to "no research available" — never a new
  request-level failure mode.
