"""Wraps two LLMClient implementations so a second provider is tried if
the primary fails after its own internal retries are exhausted.

This is deliberately a thin LLMClient itself — ChatService only ever sees
"an LLMClient", never knows whether it's talking to one provider or two,
consistent with the rest of the codebase depending on interfaces rather
than concrete implementations.

# other AppError (e.g. LLMEmptyResponseError, LLMConfigurationError) is
