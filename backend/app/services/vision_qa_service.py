"""Vision-grounded QA on full-page images (Phase 3 of multi-modal RAG).

For pages that would otherwise OCR poorly — the same
Settings.ocr_min_chars_per_page decision point extraction uses — the
stored full-page raster is sent to Gemini directly instead of trusting a
thin or empty text layer. Config-gated behind Settings.vision_qa_enabled:
each attempt is a paid Gemini vision call, so it only fires when
retrieval came back weak/insufficient and the document actually has page
rasters persisted (produced at ingestion when image_extraction_enabled
is on). Any failure degrades to None and the caller falls through to its
normal weak-retrieval path (web search, etc.).
