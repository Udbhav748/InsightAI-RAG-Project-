"""Shared structured logging for agent lifecycle events.

The multi-agent features (router_agent.py, research_agent.py) emit these
events so the checklist's collaboration metrics are computable from the
log the same way Tool Success Rate and Retry Success Rate are:

- agent_started:    a named agent began work on a task.
- agent_completed:  the agent finished, with its outcome and duration.
- agent_handoff:    control passed from one agent to another.

Handoff Accuracy and Agent Idle Time are directly derivable: a handoff
event names both ends (from/to); idle time is the gap between one agent's
agent_completed and the next agent_started with the same request_id.
