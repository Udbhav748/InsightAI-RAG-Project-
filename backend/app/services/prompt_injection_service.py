"""Lightweight heuristic detection of prompt-injection-shaped text, in
both user queries and retrieved document chunks.

Policy: flag and continue, the same shape pii_service.py already uses —
detection is not a runtime defense. The actual defense is preventive:
every retrieved chunk is wrapped in delimiter markers with an explicit
"this is untrusted data, not instructions" system-prompt instruction
(see prompt_builder.py's _INSTRUCTIONS). Before this module, the only
signal for whether that defense was ever actually tested against real
traffic was the offline eval harness's Injection Resistance metric
(dataset_v1.json's two adversarial entries) — nothing fired in
production (see docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md Q4). This module closes that gap
narrowly: a possible_injection_detected log line when suspicious
override phrasing appears, so it's visible in production logs, not just
in an offline eval run.

Patterns are a small, heuristic set covering common override phrasing —
not a classifier, and not exhaustive. False positives (a document that
legitimately discusses prompt injection as a topic, e.g. a security blog
excerpt) are expected and acceptable, since nothing here blocks or alters
behavior; it only adds a log line. Category names are logged, never the
raw matched text — same reasoning as pii_service.py's per-type counts:
the log stream shouldn't become a second place injected instructions get
echoed into.
