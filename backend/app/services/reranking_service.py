"""Cross-encoder re-ranking of a retrieval candidate pool.

Unlike the bi-encoder used for retrieval (embedding_service.py, which
embeds the query and each chunk independently so they can be compared by
vector similarity), a cross-encoder scores (query, chunk) pairs jointly —
slower per pair, but typically more accurate at judging relevance, which
is why it's used to re-order an already-narrowed candidate pool rather
than to search the whole corpus.

Lazy-loaded and cached the same way embedding_service.get_embedding_model()
is: a CrossEncoder is a real model load, done once per process and reused.
