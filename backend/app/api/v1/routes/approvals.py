"""Admin-facing human approval queue (Feature #5).

GET /approvals — list pending (or all, filterable by action/status)
  approval requests recorded when a gated action (web search,
  document deletion) was requested without its approval flag.
POST /approvals/{approval_id}/resolve — grant (approved=true) or deny
  (approved=false) a pending approval, recording who decided and an
  optional note.

Both routes are admin-gated: resolving an approval is a privileged action
analogous to ANALYTICS_VIEW, and view is scoped to admins too (the queue
is an operational surface, not something every member should be able to
browse). Follows the approach of admin.py's usage-summary route exactly —
the router-level require_auth handles authentication, and
permissions.check_permission handles authorization inline.
