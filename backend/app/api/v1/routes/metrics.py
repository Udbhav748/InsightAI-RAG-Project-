"""Live Prometheus metrics endpoint.

GET /metrics serves the in-process registry (app/core/metrics.py) in the
Prometheus text exposition format, for a real scraper to pull. The one
offline rollup the app already has (monitoring/log_aggregate.py) reads
captured logs after the fact; this endpoint is the fully live counterpart
— same underlying events (request durations, tool invocations, LLM
token/cost, loop caps, retrieval timeouts, errors), scraped at any moment.

Access control mirrors /health but one step tighter: unauthenticated by
default (any status_code is a metric; metrics carry no payload data, and
the route cost is trivial), but a METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN (when set) is
required via Authorization: Bearer, so a publicly-exposed deployment can
keep its metrics private without giving scrapers a full API key. The
token is compared via hmac.compare_digest, never logged, and a mismatch
returns 401 — indistinguishable from an unset token to a scraper.
