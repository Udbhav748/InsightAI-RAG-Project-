"""SQLAlchemy engine/session wiring for PostgreSQL persistence.

Optional by design: if Settings.database_url is empty, `engine` and
`SessionLocal` are None and `db_enabled()` returns False. Every consumer
(session store, document repository, auth) checks db_enabled() and falls
back to the legacy in-memory/file behavior, so an ephemeral deployment
that can't host a real Postgres keeps working exactly as before. See
app/core/config.py's database_url docstring.
