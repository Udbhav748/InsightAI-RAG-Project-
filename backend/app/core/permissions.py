"""Central permission registry — replaces ad-hoc `if role != "admin"`
checks scattered across route handlers with one reusable, extensible
mechanism. Deliberately small: two permissions, two roles, proportionate
to what this app's action surface actually needs today (see
docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md's RBAC section for why /upload, /chat,
/chat/feedback, etc. are NOT gated — gating them would break normal
member usage). Adding a new gated action is a 2-line change here plus
one check_permission() call at the route, not a new copy-pasted block.

Kept as a plain function (check_permission), not a FastAPI Depends() —
a dependency runs before the route body, which would reorder this ahead
of confirm/approval checks that intentionally run first (see
documents.py's delete_document). Call it inline at the exact point the
old inline block used to sit.
