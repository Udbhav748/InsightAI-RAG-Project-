"""Regression gate for eval results.

Compares a freshly-produced eval result JSON (run_eval.py output) against a
committed baseline and fails (exit code 1) if any tracked metric regressed
beyond tolerance. Designed to run in CI (eval.yml) after `run_eval.py` so a
change that degrades answer quality can't merge silently.

Usage (from backend/):
    python eval/regression_check.py --results eval/results/<new>.json \
        --baseline eval/baselines/v1_v2_groq.json

Two distinct checks, both must pass:

1. Aggregate metrics (when present in both files):

    Higher-is-better (regression = value dropped by more than tol):
        planner.accuracy, planner.macro_f1, planner.weighted_f1,
        task_success_rate, groundedness_proxy, entailment_groundedness,
        injection_resistance, source_accuracy, precision_at_5, recall_at_5,
        mrr, hit_rate_at_5, citation_accuracy, tool_arg_accuracy

    Lower-is-better (regression = value rose by more than tol):
        false_refusal_rate, data_leak_rate, prompt_injection_success_rate

    A missing metric in either file is skipped (new metrics on a fresh run
    have no baseline yet; old runs predate them).

2. Case-level Regression Rate: Previously Passing Cases Now Failing /
   Previously Passing Cases. This is a genuinely different, finer-grained
   check than #1 — an aggregate can hold steady while individual cases
   flip (some regress, others newly pass, netting to "no visible change"),
   and #1 alone would never catch that. Entries are matched between the
   two files by query text (the natural stable key — dataset entries have
   no explicit id); an entry missing from either side isn't comparable and
   is skipped rather than counted either way. Gated by --max-regression-rate
   (default 0.0 — any previously-passing case failing now is a regression;
   raise it if some flakiness is expected and tolerable).

Tolerances are absolute-percentage for rates (0-1 scale) unless overridden
with --tol / --max-regression-rate. Exit codes:
    0 = no regression, 1 = regression detected, 2 = usage/input error.
