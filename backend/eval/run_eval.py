"""Evaluation harness for ChatService's planner and answers.

Runs every entry in a dataset file (see eval/README.md) through
ChatService._plan (for planner classification) and ChatService.handle_query
(for the actual answer), then reports:

- a confusion matrix + accuracy/precision/recall/F1 for planner routing
- Tool-argument accuracy: for expected_action == "summarize" entries, did
  the planner extract the right document_id from the query, not just
  pick the right action? Routing and argument extraction are separate
  failure modes (see PlanDecision in rag_service.py) and the confusion
  matrix above only covers the former.
- Task Success Rate: does the answer contain an expected keyword?
- Groundedness proxy (lexical): for retrieval answers, do they share vocabulary with
  the chunks that were actually retrieved? (Word-overlap heuristic, NOT a faithfulness check)
- Entailment groundedness (LLM-as-judge): for retrieval answers, does an LLM judge
  find the answer actually supported by the retrieved context? (Structured yes/no,
  uses same UNTRUSTED DOCUMENT EXCERPT delimiters as prompt_builder)
- Injection Resistance: for adversarial entries, did the answer avoid
  complying with the injected instruction?
- False Refusal Rate: of the entries that should get a real answer
  (case_type not in "adversarial"/"failure" — those two are designed to
  correctly trigger a decline), what fraction got FALLBACK_REPLY instead
  of an actual answer? The inverse failure mode from Task Success Rate:
  that measures wrongly answering, this measures wrongly declining.
- Data Leak Rate: across every entry (not just adversarial ones), does
  the answer contain any of the dataset's injection_marker strings —
  the same strings Injection Resistance already checks per-entry, but
  checked against every entry's answer here, since a leak isn't
  necessarily provoked only by the adversarial prompt designed to elicit
  it.
- Source Accuracy: for entries with an expected_source, did
  ChatResponse.answer_source ("documents"/"web"/"mixed") match it? Only
  meaningful with Settings.web_search_enabled=true — see dataset_v2.json's
  two web-findable entries and eval/README.md.
- Precision@5 / Recall@5 / MRR: for entries with expected_chunk_keywords,
  how good was *retrieval itself* (independent of the generated answer)?
  A retrieved chunk is "relevant" if it contains any of the entry's
  expected_chunk_keywords — see precision_at_k/recall_at_k/reciprocal_rank
  below for exactly what each measures, and eval/README.md for the
  worked definitions. This is what the "Retrieval ablation" numbers in
  docs/OPERATIONS.md are built from.
- Citation Accuracy: same entries as Precision@5/Recall@5/MRR, but a
  different question from either that or Groundedness proxy. Groundedness
  checks whether the *answer text* shares vocabulary with any retrieved
  chunk; Precision@5 checks whether *retrieval* pulled back relevant
  chunks at all. This checks the actual citation surface a caller sees —
  ChatResponse.sources — and whether at least one of *those specific*
  excerpts contains real supporting evidence for the claim, using the
  same keyword-support heuristic as Precision@5. This is the automated
  version of what docs/HUMAN_EVAL.md row 4 caught by hand: a correct
  answer whose 5 listed sources didn't obviously contain the definition.
- Hit Rate@5: for the same expected_chunk_keywords entries, whether at
  least one relevant chunk appeared in the top-5 retrieved — the binary
  "did retrieval surface anything relevant at all" complement to MRR's
  rank-weighted version.
- Schema Compliance Rate + Field Accuracy: every required ChatResponse
  field must be present and populated with a semantically valid value
  (non-empty answer, known tool_used/answer_source, steps_taken >= 1,
  list-typed retrieved_chunks/sources, non-empty session_id). Schema
  Compliance = all checks pass for an entry; Field Accuracy = fraction
  of individual field checks passing across all entries.
- Plan-Execution Consistency: whether the tool that actually executed
  matches the planner's decided action (e.g. "retrieve" -> tool_used in
  {retrieval, web_search}). Detects routing claiming one thing while the
  pipeline does another.
- Tool Success Rate (per tool): fraction of runs routed to each tool
  that completed without an AppError. Failed runs are attributed to an
  "error" bucket since which tool failed isn't known at this level.
- Step Efficiency + Avg Steps: steps_taken vs the minimal expected step
  count per action (see EXPECTED_MIN_STEPS) — how close each run was to
  the leanest path; corrective-loop retries and web-search detours drive
  it down.
- Memory Recall Rate: for entries with `history` and
  expected_memory_keywords, whether the answer used context that could
  only have come from an earlier turn (not the current query).

Requires a real GEMINI_API_KEY (this calls the live LLM) and at least one
document already indexed in the backend's vector store — see
eval/README.md for both preconditions.
