"""Quantitative RAG Evaluation & Benchmarking Script for InsightAI-RAG.

Evaluates and benchmarks the hybrid RRF + Cross-Encoder retrieval and answer
generation pipeline against a golden dataset of 20 plant pathology Q&A pairs
covering major agricultural crops (Tomato, Potato, Apple, Corn, Grape, Orange, Pepper).

Standard RAG Metrics Computed:
1. Faithfulness Score (0.0 - 1.0):
   Evaluates whether claims in the generated answer are grounded in the retrieved context chunks.
2. Context Recall (0.0 - 1.0):
   Evaluates whether ground-truth active ingredients and organic remedies are present in retrieved chunks.
3. Context Precision (0.0 - 1.0):
   Computes rank-weighted precision (Average Precision @ K / Mean Reciprocal Rank) of relevant chunks.
4. Answer Relevance (0.0 - 1.0):
   Evaluates semantic embedding similarity and topic alignment between query and generated answer.
5. Harmonic Composite RAG Score (0.0 - 1.0):
   Weighted composite & harmonic blend across all active evaluation dimensions.

Usage:
