"""Shared pytest helpers for the backend test suite.

SCHEMA_COMPLIANCE is a tiny shared counter: assert_matches_schema() bumps
it every time a test validates a response body against one of the app's
Pydantic response models, and pytest_terminal_summary prints the
resulting compliance rate in the final test report.

# Force DB-disabled for the whole test session, regardless of whatever
# backend/.env has DATABASE_URL set to for live/manual use. Every test in
# this suite that needs DB-backed behavior (tenant/role resolution,
# session listing, ownership checks, ...) already mocks the specific
# function it needs (resolve_tenant, get_document_owner, etc.) rather
# than hitting a real database — that's this suite's one, consistent
# convention, not an exception. A real DATABASE_URL in the ambient
# environment has broken this twice already (once from a stray local
# Postgres/SQLite value, once from that value silently making individual
# user login "work" in tests that assumed it couldn't) — this line makes
# that class of bug structurally impossible instead of trusting everyone
# sharing this environment to remember to unset it by hand. Must run
# before any `app.*` import anywhere (conftest.py is always the first
# thing pytest loads in this directory, before test collection), since
# Settings() and database.py's engine are both built once at import time.
